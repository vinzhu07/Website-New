        <h1>Bridge</h1>
        <p>
            When people ask me about my hobby, I always have a dilemma. Do I tell them about bridge, and get the
            classic "isn't that
            an old person game?" response or answer something more normal like tennis? However, I can't blame them
            because most kids
            are unaware of what bridge truly is. I used to be in their shoes and not know what bridge was. Thinking
            back to
            elementary school, before I got into bridge and invested the next 6 years of my life into this card
            game, I never would
            have guessed that my bridge passion would have turned out how it has.

        </p>
        <p>
            During the summer of 4th grade, my parents signed my brother, who is two years older than me, and I up
            for a week-long
            camp at our local Ocee library for something called bridge. At that time, I had no idea what bridge was.
            I don't think
            anyone who attended the camp knew. One of my closest bridge friends thought bridge literally meant
            building a bridge
            using cards. At this camp, I learned that bridge was a complex card game that involved both bidding and
            card play. It
            requires 4 people, or 2 pairs. After this weeklong 10 hour camp I was hooked. After a casual first year
            of weekly
            classes on Mondays at Ocee library under Ms. Karen, who hosted the camp, Ms. Karen recommended me to Ms.
            Eckert. Ms.
            Eckert taught advanced kids, while Ms. Karen specialized with beginners.

        </p>
        <p>
            The last student that Ms. Eckert took under her wing, I was introduced to a group of students from the
            Alpharetta area
            who are mostly my brother's age. For the next 5 years, Ms. Eckert taught this group of kids every Friday
            for 2 hours at
            her house, and we practiced on Sunday's under the USBF Junior Training Program. Aside from all this
            practice, we needed
            real experience, so we constantly played in games. Due to school, we typically only played once a month,
            playing
            whenever we had a school day off. The two clubs that we played the most at were in Alpharetta and
            Roswell, due to their
            rather close distance. Each game lasted around 3 hours, and costs kids around $7 and adults $15. It was
            at these games
            that I was able to see the local bridge scene, as outside of those clubs, and my fellow students, no one
            played the
            game, or even really knew what it was. Matches at these local clubs were mostly against adults, as the
            junior scene in
            Atlanta was below par. However, the first few years I played there were junior games a few times a year.
            Two of my best
            games ever were at juniors games where my pair got a score of 70%, which is outstanding considering
            anything over 60% is
            really good.

        </p>
        <p>
            As our desire to compete grew, we decided to travel further to play. Over longer breaks, we drove
            further to participate in larger events, such as regionals and sectionals. For example, we played at
            Crown Plaza, Conyers, Gainesville, and even spent a week in Charleston! At Crown Plaza I arguably had my
            best game ever in a team of 4 with my Alpharetta friends, placing first out of 45 teams. Charleston was
            my favorite bridge experience, as 8 of my bridge friends travelled to Charleston in South Carolina for a
            whole week with the sole purpose of playing bridge, with two adults. The whole week was dedicated to
            playing bridge, as even if we wanted to we were unable to go travel around and visit the attractions, as
            we couldn't drive. Each day we had the same schedule: wake up, play bridge, eat, play bridge, eat,
            sleep. We played a minimum of two games, and three if we woke up early enough. I played and performed
            well enough to win the most masterpoints out of anyone in my category. We also got accused of cheating
            during this tournament. Between the rounds us kids would often get together and chat about random
            things, and a lady who saw us thought we were telling each other about the boards we had just played,
            and told our teacher; we ended up having to go apologize to the lady and not congregate between rounds.

        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of places within driving distance, I also competed at the Youth NABC for five years, from
            2012-2016. These
            nationals were held across the country, and I travelled to Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Washington DC, and
            Chicago to
            compete at them, and one was held here in Atlanta. It was at these Junior NABC's that I finally was able
            to meet the
            youth scene in bridge, and arguably what kept me coming back to bridge, as I made lots of friends
            through these events.
            On average around 300 kids show up for a three day event, which includes one warmup day, a pairs
            championship and a team
            championship. I never did well in the pairs championship, with my highest placing coming 9th in 2016.
            However, team
            wise, my team of six managed to place 3rd in 2015, my proudest achievement. Outside of results, Youth
            NABC was always a
            great experience to meet some of the best bridge players in the country, and even foreign players. I've
            made countless
            friends through Youth NABC, and it is a real shame that 2016 was the last year that I competed, as my
            Alpharetta group
            have now moved on in life and no longer play, and are too old anyways. While I love all of them and will
            always remember
            them, two stand out, Alec and Caleb. These two were my favorite partners. I first played with Alec for a
            year before
            switching over the Caleb and playing with him for over three years. In bridge, the pairs must have good
            chemistry and be
            able to communicate effectively, and I found a connection with Caleb that I have yet and most likely
            will never find
            again.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2013, by coincidence the 3rd World Youth Open Bridge Championships was held in Atlanta right after
            nationals, and
            to 11 year old me with nothing to do at home, I had nothing to lose, so I entered with Caleb to get a
            taste of
            international bridge. This was my first experience playing with screens and no talking, so I was
            honestly quite
            intimidated. We performed as expected, starting off average and ending around in the bottom third of the
            pairs. However,
            due to a miscommunication between our opponents, we actually were ranked in the top 10 for a brief
            period of time! This
            experience allowed to meet many of the world's best players and get first hand experience of the special
            rules that
            are used in international bridge. While the competition is open to anyone who meets the age
            requirements, the USA
            typically sponsors one or two teams per event and pays for all their expenses. Therefore, in 2015 and
            2017, I tried
            out for the U21 team as trials were held in Atlanta. In 2015, I tried out with my usual group of
            friends. We ended up
            doing worse than expected, placing 6th out of the 7 teams present. When 2017 rolled around, the majority
            of my friends
            had already moved on from bridge and entered college, so I competed with a team that I had never met
            before. Similarly
            to before, I ended up placing 6th out of the 6 teams present.
        </p>

            After the 2017 USBF trials, I began taking a break from bridge. I was unable to commit the hours
            necessary to improve
            to the next level and decided that the best choice for me was to take a break for a few years. The
            results from trials
            really showed how far I was in terms of quality from the best players in the country.
        </p>

            Ms. Eckert sacrificed her hard work and time for our group of kids free of charge. She drove us to all
            the games,
            taught us everything we know, and was a constant light in my life. Ms. Eckert was responsible for the
            best 5 years of
            my life. Always positive, she was always there for my bridge group throughout our journey, through the
            ups and downs.
            In 2016, when I was a high school freshman, Ms. Eckert suffered a stroke, and was forced to stop playing
            and teaching
            bridge. She soon moved an hour away to be near her kids, and I was never able to see her again. Towards
            the end of
            2018, I was notified out of the blue of her death by my brother. This news shocked me, and I have never
            truly gotten
            over it, and I still think of her all the time, missing her positive personality, and never haven gotten
            the
            opportunity to fully show my appreciation to her. She was there for my team after we were destroyed in
            trials for the
            United States Junior Bridge team, and she was there when we placed third place at youth nationals in
            Chicago. I was
            only able to achieve everything I have in bridge thanks to her seeing potential in me and taking me in.
            Ms. Eckert was
            and will always be an inspiration to me and I strive to be like her in the future. Everytime I play I
            think of her and
            her dedication and continue to improve. I also have to give credit to Ms. Karen for introducing me to
            Ms. Eckert
            because on my own I never would have known her. Despite having stopped playing bridge, it is merely a
            hiatus and I
            promise myself that I will not quit and that I will get back into this hobby of mine, no matter how old
            I will be
            then. I have made some of my favorite memories ever playing bridge with kids and adults alike, and I
            would not replace
            these memories with anything else. If you ever read this, Alec and Caleb, thank you for everything that
            you have done
            for me. To the others who know who they are, thank you as well.

            There are a few boards and matches that I will never forget. Once at Crown Plaza, our team blitzed the
            first three
            rounds, which means that we obtained the maximum number of points possible in those rounds, which being
            able to do in
            one round is already an achievement. Another board was at World's in 2013. Playing one of the best pairs
            in the
            nation, we lucked out on a miscommunication and they ended up making a disastrous accident, which
            allowed Caleb and I
            to luck out and be top 10 in the world for just a few minutes. Miscommunications happen all the time to
            everyone
            including myself, and one that I will never forget was at a midnight knockout match with a friend who
            I've never
            played with before. Due to a lack of experience, our bidding went astray quickly as I thought he
            promised both spades
            and either clubs or diamonds when he reality he only had spades. This ended up negating insanely good
            play from our
            teammates as we got doubled and went down around 5. This list of memorable boards will only grow as I
            continue to play
            in the future.

            Throughout 2018 I mentioned to my friends about hosting a bridge camp, but no concrete progress was
            made, and after
            Ms. Eckert's death late in 2018, I felt even more compelled to host this camp as a way to pay my final
            respects to
            her. After positive encouragement from my closest friends, I reached out to Ms. Tucker, a longtime
            bridge teacher who
            heads the Atlanta Junior Bridge program. After pitching my idea of hosting a camp, she was eager to help
            me put this
            idea into reality. We initially met at Ocee library, but when we inquired about hosting this camp, we
            were
            unfortunately told that the library was closed for renovation over the summer. Refusing to let this
            hinder my plans, I
            reached out to countless other libraries and public places, such as churches. After about 5 rejections,
            the manager of
            the Gwinnett County Public Library Suwanee branch showed interest and after a period of long discussion,
            Mr. Freeman
            offered me a spot to host my bridge camp during the week of July 22 to 26.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we approached the week of camp, I inquired and was told that 16 kids had signed up. And as promised,
            16 kids showed
            up on Monday. With almost all of them returning Tuesday, I began to have hope, but after teaching
            bidding, half of the
            kids decided it was too difficult and left. Throughout the week, the attendance steadily declined, and
            on Friday only
            4 kids showed up. While I was disappointed, many kids had notified me that they were to be absent on
            Friday, so I
            never was that optimistic. Although the attendance was not up to my expectations, this was a great
            learning experience
            for my time teaching a bridge class.

            Early in 2021, the first collegiate tournament rolled around, which I had been looking forward to since
            my first time playing with GT. The first weekend, I only played the first half, and we ended up 8th out
            of 15, not a bad finish for my first official competition. The next weekend, GT White placed 2nd out of
            10! GT actually swept the competition, with the top three finishes. Also around then, starting in
            February, GT bridge started meeting in person, and I met a bunch of new people, but it was still toned
            down as opposed to pre-covid times. I managed to run unopposed for secretary so I became the 2021-22
            secretary. The rest of the semester I continued playing some casual collegiate matches, ending with a
            record of 11-11-2 at the end of May.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Grand National Teams rolled around in June, and I was excited to compete for the first time. I've
            qualified in the past with my friends from Alpharetta, but I've never participated in the finals, and
            with COVID, they waived the qualification requirements.
            Round 1. Nice. Round 2. Nice. Round 3. Nice. Round 4. Nice. Round 5. Nice. Round 6. Nice. Round 7. Nice.
            We miraculously won our first seven rounds, and despite losing our round against the GT A team, we
            placed first, qualifying to represent District 7 at nationals!
            District B finals didn't go as well, placing 17th out of 30, but with tougher competition, we came in
            with lower expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
            For nationals, we had to have 2 new partnerships, out of the 4, so we knew coming in it'd be a little
            bumpy. After sitting out the first session, we were exactly on the qualification spot, 16th, as the top
            16 out of the 38 teams would progress. However, the second session didn't go too well, as we won two and
            lost two rounds, and anxiously awaited the final results. What a disheartening moment as we ended up
            17th. The possibility that making the one contract that went down in the last round may have brought us
            to 16th made it even worse.
        </p>

        <p>
            Collegiates also occurred this year, although participation suffered significantly due to it being
            online. I competed in the pairs and came 10th out of 12 pairs, but it was with a new partner, so I
            wasn't too bothered.
        </p>

        <p>The start of the sophomore year also meant the return of in person bridge, as Georgia Tech transitioned
            to in-person. I started off with tabling at grad expo the week before classes started, and also tabled
            at org fair a few weeks later. Surprisingly, we managed to hold a very steady and impressive 20+
            attendance at the majority of our meetings. It was amazing to meet all the experienced returning players
            while also meeting newcomers. Being on leadership, I felt a responsibility to teach so I did that
            whenever needed. </p>

        <p>Fall semester went well, and as spring semester rolled out so did the Collegiates. For both team
            tournaments, I was on the B team. The first time, we got 5th and the A team got 4th. Unfortunately for
            us however, only the top three schools each team tournament win a package, so we were just short on
            luck. The next week, in the other team tournament, we managed to beat the A team, but choked hard at the
            end, ending up 6th, and the fourth place school yet again. Demoralized, we headed into the pairs
            tournament, which rewarded six travel packages, three for strat A and three of strat B. Our top pair got
            4th in strat A, narrowly missing out on a package, and by some miracle, Justin and I, who got 8th
            overall, managed to win a travel package, which included $500 stipend for air fare and three night
            hotel!</p>

        <p>Leading up to the collegiate bridge bowl in July, I had weekly practices with my partner. I had been partners
            with this guy for about a year now, but ironically he was not who I won the package with. Unfortunately for
            me, nationals was in Providence. This proved to be annoying as I was in Seattle for the summer, so I had to
            fly to Boston and then make my way to Providence. Luckily my partner was in Boston for the summer, so he
            drove me to Providence, but the way back I wasn't so lucky because my flight was at 8AM. On the B team, we
            placed 7th out of the 12 teams in the qualifying day of the team event, and got knocked out in the
            quarterfinals on day 2. Our A team had gotten the first seed, but were upset in the quarterfinals and also
            lost in the quarterfinals. The pairs event went alright. We managed a decent score of 55% in the morning
            session, but the afternoon session we barely managed around a 47%, leading us to a disappointing finish
            overall. If you'd like to read about some of the fun things I did at nationals, check my summer 2022 recap.
            However, the one silver lining about nationals is that I found a USBF U26 trials team! Ever since I saw the
            news that the USBF Jr trials were happening this year, I wanted to play but had no team. Luckily, my hotel
            roommate, who wasn't even my bridge partner, was also interested in playing at trials, and after a couple
            nights of late night bridge talks, we agreed to play together at trials in December. While my partner had
            learned bridge significantly later than me, she had infinitely more connections and knew all the good USBF
            juniors. She was able to put together not only a team for us but also a couple more teams for both our event
            and the rona (girls) event.</p>
