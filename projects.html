        <p>Here I will talk about some of the projects I have worked on in the past, some of which may be very short and small and hence not on my resume.</p>
        <p><b>Uber Clone (October - November 2022)</b>: I worked on a website that was a clone of Uber for my Cloud Computing final project. We utilized AWS services, including Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and Cognito.
            This website allowed users to sign up either as a driver or a rider. If you sign up as a driver, you then register your vehicle by filling out information and uploading a picture of the car. After that, you would then be directed to a page with the open requests.
            If you signed up as a rider, you could then see where all of the current drivers are. The drivers' vehicles were randomly located around Georgia Tech. The CloudWatch called a Lambda function every minute that slightly moved the vehicles, mimicing movement. As a rider, you can request a ride and if any taxi is available, you get the taxi that is the closest one to you
